    "Suppose we are designing learning algorithms. We would like to have an algorithm so good, but so good, that it will be effective in every conceivable problem. Both of the theorems discussed show that this is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wolpert's theorem shows that we must at least implicitly assume something about the kinds of problems we will be solving with our algorithm. If we try to be equally good for all possible problems, every algorithm has the same performance. This means that an algorithm that always predicts the same label Y for any input will have the same performance, on average, than the fanciest neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, even if we cannot define explicitly $P(f)$, algorithm designers and machine learning practitioners do know implicitly something about it. \n",
    "We know that, because some of the algorithms we use are better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Shwartz & David's theorem proves that no learning algorithm will be universally good. \n",
    "There will always be some problems for which its performance will be bad.\n",
    "Furthermore, for those problems, there will be some learning algorithms that will have good performance.\n",
